## Restaurant Booking System:

You have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.

### MVP:

Your system must be able to:

* Allow a customer to book a table at the restaurant for a particular time and date
* Update a booking, for example if the customer wants to change a booking time
* Display a list of bookings for a given date
* Display a list of customers ordered by frequency of visits

### Project Extensions:

* Don't allow double bookings
* Add a customer's receipt to a booking so you can view their previous orders and how much they spent
* Calculate how much a customer has spent over a given period of time
* Give discounts to frequent customers
* Whatever features you think would be beneficial to a restaurant
